# LSESolver: Solving the Lippman-Schwinger Equation 

Project 1 in Nuclear Forces PHY989
We provide results for the singles S phase shift by solving the
Lippman-Schwinger equation and the variable phase approach (see  
VPAScattering_elman_longfellow_votaw.nb).

To make the executable for solving the Lippman-Schwinger equation,
do:

make 

Must have armadillo installed. To run the code, the input is as fellow:

./lsesolver [# MESH POINTS] [LAB ENERGY (MEV)] ["well" or "yukawa" for potential] [print verbose (1) or non-verbose (0)]


If verbose (1) printing is chosen, it will print a full sentence and extra
information for the well potential. If non-verbose (0) is chosen, it will only
print out lab energy and the phase shift in degrees.

Final report is stored in doc/ folder.
